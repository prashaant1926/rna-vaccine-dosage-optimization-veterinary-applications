## Research Problem

**Core Question**: How can we design effective dosing regimens for mRNA vaccines in veterinary applications across species of varying body weights and physiological characteristics?

**Problem Significance**: Current veterinary vaccine dosing largely relies on one-size-fits-all approaches or simple linear scaling from human data, ignoring species-specific pharmacokinetics, immunological responses, and the unique properties of mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems. This leads to potential under-dosing (reduced efficacy) or over-dosing (increased adverse effects and cost).

## Identified Literature Priors

### Prior 1: Allometric Scaling Limitations in Biologics

**Established across literature**: Traditional allometric scaling (body weight^0.75) works for small molecule drugs but shows limitations for biologics, particularly vaccines where immune system architecture varies significantly between species.

### Prior 2: mRNA-LNP System Complexity

**Established in recent research**: mRNA vaccines encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles exhibit species-specific biodistribution, cellular uptake, and clearance patterns that are not captured by simple body weight scaling.

### Prior 3: Immune Response Variability

**Implicit across veterinary immunology**: Different animal species have varying immune system maturation rates, lymphoid organ sizes relative to body weight, and antigen presentation efficiency.

## Research Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (∃ X Type)

**H1**: It is possible to construct a multi-parameter predictive model for mRNA vaccine dosing in veterinary species that incorporates:

* Allometric scaling principles (body weight^β where β varies by physiological system)
* Species-specific immune parameters (lymphoid organ mass ratios, immune cell densities)
* mRNA-LNP pharmacokinetic factors (clearance rates, tissue distribution coefficients)

**Impact**: This would enable precise, species-specific dosing that maximizes efficacy while minimizing adverse effects across veterinary applications.

### Secondary Hypotheses (X > Y Type)

**H2**: Multi-parameter dosing models will outperform traditional body weight-only scaling in achieving target immune responses across species.

**H3**: Incorporating immune system scaling factors (lymphoid organ mass, immune cell turnover rates) will improve dosing accuracy more than pharmacokinetic factors alone.

### Mechanistic Hypothesis (Bounding X)

**H4**: The optimal dosing model structure will vary by vaccine target (respiratory vs systemic pathogens) due to different tissue-specific immune requirements and mRNA-LNP distribution patterns.

## Research Direction & Impact

This research challenges the fundamental assumption that simple body weight scaling is sufficient for mRNA vaccine dosing in veterinary applications. Success would:

1. **Reshape veterinary vaccine development** by providing rational, evidence-based dosing frameworks
2. **Reduce development costs** by minimizing dose-finding studies through predictive modeling
3. **Improve animal welfare** through optimized efficacy and reduced adverse effects
4. **Enable rapid response** to emerging veterinary diseases with scientifically-grounded dosing

The approach follows the principle that impactful research identifies assumptions spanning multiple areas of existing work and proposes fundamental improvements to established practices.
